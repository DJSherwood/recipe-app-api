# Recipe API Project
This is a project created from the Udemy course **Build a Backend REST API with Python & Django** by Mark Winterbottom. 
As can be inferred from the title, Django serves as a backend API via which a user can obtain a token, and then upload or download data.

The course also introduces Docker, test-driven development, and the use of linting via github actions. 
The final module of the course involves uploading the Django app to an EC2 instance on AWS.

The available interfaces are rendered via swagger as shown below:
